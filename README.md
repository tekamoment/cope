# cope

This project is an abandoned application concept designed to help track a user's mental health and medication. 

Cope contained a survey designed to measure the user's emotional state, and display the collected information in a digestible manner suitable for both user and any source of psychological help.

The app also had a medicine tracker, notifying users of their dosage times and quantities in order to help them cope with their mental condition.
